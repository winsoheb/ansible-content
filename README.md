# Ansible Content for System Automation

This repository contains Ansible playbooks, roles, and best practices for automating various system administration tasks. Ansible allows you to manage configurations, deploy software, and orchestrate more complex IT tasks.

- **Agentless**: Requires no software to be installed on managed systems.
- **Idempotent**: Ensures the desired state without reapplying unnecessary changes.
- **Easy to Learn**: Uses YAML for writing playbooks, making it human-readable.

## Key Features
- **Playbooks**: Declarative scripts for automation.
- **Roles**: Reusable sets of Ansible tasks.
- **Inventory**: Defines the hosts and groups of systems to automate.
